# FGBoost Regression Python Example
This example shows how to build a 2-clients FGBoost Regression application.


### Data
This example uses [House Price]() dataset from Kaggle. We provide a copy of dataset [here](), and split the dataset in two parts by [split script]().

The data files used here are [vfl-house-price-1.csv](), [vfl-house-price-2.csv](), which represent the two data files held by two parties.
