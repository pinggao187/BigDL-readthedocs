# BigDL-Nano ONNX Runtime Example - Pytorch-lightning/cifar_resnet18

This example is adapted from https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/lightning-tutorials/blob/main/lightning_examples/cifar10-baseline/baseline.py which uses a resnet18 to train and test the classification task of cifar.

**Currently, the example is NOT READY and will be updated soon.**
